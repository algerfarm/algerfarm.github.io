They can go home with their new families starting on October 6th. They are F1B golden doodles from Coralee and Rigby and are expected to be between 35-50 lbs full grown.

                  Our family has been breeding dogs over the last 20 years out of Franklin and Charlotte, NC. We have bred a variety of dogs including Golden Retrievers, St. Bernard’s, Huskies, and now Golden Doodles. The Alger family fell in love with Golden Retrievers and their friendly nature, easy training and obedience, and love for children.<br><br>
                We have had 100% success rate with our puppies. Both parents are CKC registered dogs that come from a lineage of AKC registered dogs. The mother (Coralee) is an F1 Golden Doodle with a dark red coat. The father (Rigby) is a standard Parti Poodle with several colors. Both parents are very strong adult dogs with great personalities who are intelligent and loving to their respective families.

            <p class="large text-muted">We are a young, recently married couple with our dog Coralee. She has become more than just our pet--she is family. We both have come from families that have owned several different breeds of dogs that were all unique in their own way, but none as much as our goldendoodle Cora. Micah takes her to work almost every day, and at night she cuddles up on the couch with me (Naomi). Since I have allergies to dogs, this has been particularly special to me.
              <br><br>
            Cora goes everywhere with us from hiking in the mountains to swimming in the lake. She loves to spend time with us and to be a part of our adventures. Cora has become a very personal, special part of our family. She picks up on our emotions, and often exemplifies the same ones to match. Cora gets incredibly excited when we come home--nothing stands in her way (not even a treat!) until we acknowledge her and show her love.
              <br><br>
            Ask anyone with a goldendoodle and they will tell you similar stories. Her calm demeanor, intelligence, and personality compare to none.  We love our little addition to the family, and we hope you will find one for yours too!

                    <br><br>
                    Coralee is a miniature F1 Golden Doodle with a beautiful, curly, red coat. Her parents were AKC golden retriever (dam) and AKC poodle (sire).  She weighs about 30 lbs, and is considered to be a “miniature golden doodle”. She is a phenomenal mother who constantly takes care of her babies. Coralee is incredibly intelligent, has a calm temperament, and loves to please. She is eager to learn and loves an abundance of praise.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyone who meets Coralee can tell she is lovable, well-mannered, and gentle with children. While unlikely to attack, golden doodles make great watchdogs. They signal loudly when strangers approach, and many have the golden retriever talents such as hunting, tracking, retrieving, agility, and service dogs.
